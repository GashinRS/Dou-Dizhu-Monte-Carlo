# Dou-Dizhu-Monte-Carlo
This is a university project made @Ghent-University.

For this project we made a bot that plays [Dou Dizhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu), a popular Chinese
card game. Our bot is based on the [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm
and was made with [RLCard](https://rlcard.org/). We also made a simple visual interface to play against the bot.

For more detailed information about our implementaion, we also wrote a [paper](https://github.com/GashinRS/Dou-Dizhu-Monte-Carlo/blob/main/verslag.pdf). 
Please note however that this paper is written in Dutch.
